First I changed the integer to a string so that I could split each number of the integer into an array. Then a used a basic for loop to change each element of the array to an integer (so I could perform math) and pushed the integers to a new array. Next I looped through the array of integers and added each one to a variable called "added". Now we have the sum of all the integers in the given number. The next step was to check whether or not the "added" number was even or odd. I used the modulus operator and checked if the remainder = 0 and therefore even or not 0 and therefore odd.

Here is a screenshot of my code. Shorter solutions to come...
