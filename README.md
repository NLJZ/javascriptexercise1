#### Oddish vs Evenish Solution 2

The second solution differs from the first in a few ways.

1. I created the a number string array with one step (combining the num.toString and split into one line.
2. One loop! Instead of looping through and changing each element of the array into an integer and then looping through again to perform the addition - the loop switches the string element of the array to the integer and then adds during the one loop.
3. This solution uses the forEach loop method of es6 instead of the standard for loop.

4. Instead of if...else i used the ternary operator to shorten the code.

Here is a screnshot of my new code:
